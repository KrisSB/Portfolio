# <a href="https://krissb.github.io/Portfolio/">Portfolio Website using React and Sass</a>

This website was made using React in the front-end and Sass and help design the webpage. It uses React Spring to animate the navigation bar as well as the projects page. It uses React router to seemlessly change between the pages. It also takes advantage of Sass to create mixins for the css as well as sass functions to change the backgrounds.
